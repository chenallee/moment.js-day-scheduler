# moment.js-day-scheduler
## description: 
The goal was to create a scheduler for each hour of a 9-5 workday using local storage and time supported by moment.js. 

## made in Visual Studio using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
5. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
6. JavaScript
7. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
8. [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

## final thoughts:
I found this a bit challenging for several reasons. Firstly, although I didn't use too much of the API, I had to find tutorials and read documentation to understand moment.js well enough to use what I needed. Secondly, I kept forgetting syntax and ended up trying to use a mix of JavaScript and jQuery selectors and functions that didn't work together at all. 

Through completing this project, I realize that in addition to practicing and reviewing syntax of different languages, I should also take more care to plan out my application with pseudocode and clear comments so the modules are more efficient and I don't forget features. For example, I initialized the array of todo objects in a function that I later removed since after it was created, I retrieved the data from localstorage. When I tested the deployed application, it didn't work! If I had a better plan or documentation, I would not have taken out this essential part.

As for further learning, I'm really excited to work more with new HTML features that make things easier by reducing redundant JS such as custom data attributes. I'd love to master the use of new HTML features.
